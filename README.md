# ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of an insurance company's Customer Care team for 23 days. The dataset includes information about agents' call durations and statuses. AI tools like IVR, RPA, Predictive Analytics, and Intelligent Routing are used to improve customer experience.

## Project Files

- `ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis.pptx`: The main presentation file detailing the analysis and insights.

## Tech Stack Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft PowerPoint

## Approach

- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Acquired and cleaned the dataset.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted various analytical tasks using Excel.
- **Insight Generation**: Extracted meaningful insights and proposed strategies for improvement.

## Data Analytics Tasks:
You have been provided with a dataset that contains information about the inbound calls received by a company named ABC, which operates in the insurance sector. Your task is to use this data to answer the following questions:

Average Call Duration: Determine the average duration of all incoming calls received by agents. This should be calculated for each time bucket.
Your Task: What is the average duration of calls for each time bucket?

Call Volume Analysis: Visualize the total number of calls received. This should be represented as a graph or chart showing the number of calls against time. Time should be represented in buckets (e.g., 1-2, 2-3, etc.).
Your Task: Can you create a chart or graph that shows the number of calls received in each time bucket?

Manpower Planning: The current rate of abandoned calls is approximately 30%. Propose a plan for manpower allocation during each time bucket (from 9 am to 9 pm) to reduce the abandon rate to 10%. In other words, you need to calculate the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to ensure that at least 90 out of 100 calls are answered.
Your Task: What is the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to reduce the abandon rate to 10%?

Night Shift Manpower Planning: Customers also call ABC Insurance Company at night but don't get an answer because there are no agents available. This creates a poor customer experience. Assume that for every 100 calls that customers make between 9 am and 9 pm, they also make 30 calls at night between 9 pm and 9 am. The distribution of these 30 calls is as follows:
Your Task: Propose a manpower plan for each time bucket throughout the day, keeping the maximum abandon rate at 10%.

Assumptions: An agent works for 6 days a week; On average, each agent takes 4 unplanned leaves per month; An agent's total working hours are 9 hours, out of which 1.5 hours are spent on lunch and snacks in the office. On average, an agent spends 60% of their total actual working hours (i.e., 60% of 7.5 hours) on calls with customers/users. The total number of days in a month is 30.

## Key Findings

- The current abandon rate is approximately 30%.
- Proposals for manpower planning to reduce the abandon rate to 10%.
- Identified patterns and trends in call volumes and durations.

## Learnings

- Forecasting
- Problem-Solving
- Manpower Management

## Conclusion

This project was challenging and has helped enhance my skills in Excel usage and data analysis.
